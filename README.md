# duotoner (gradient mapper)

Have you ever thought to yourself "Hey, I'd really like to be able to add a gradient map to images in the browser instead of an environment more suited"? Perhaps you've wondered "Wouldn't it be cool to do something in canvas instead of using a SVG filter like any sane developer", me too. Just don't upload any large images because it'll probably crash your browser.
